        <b>The Facebook Papers may be the biggest crisis in the company's history</b><br>
        Facebook has confronted whistleblowers, PR firestorms and Congressional inquiries in recent years. But now it
        faces a combination of all three at once in what could be the most intense and wide-ranging crisis in the
        company's 17-year history. <br><br>

        On Friday, a consortium of 17 US news organizations began publishing a series of stories — collectively called
        "The Facebook Papers" — based on a trove of hundreds of internal company documents which were included in
        disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook
        whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel. The consortium, which includes CNN, reviewed the redacted versions
        received by Congress.<br>
        CNN's coverage includes stories about how coordinated groups on Facebook (FB) sow discord and violence,
        including on January 6, as well as Facebook's challenges moderating content in some non-English-speaking
        countries, and how human traffickers have used its platforms to exploit people.<br><br>

        The reports from CNN, and the other outlets that are part of the consortium, follow a month of intense scrutiny
        for the company. The Wall Street Journal previously published a series of stories based on tens of thousands of
        pages of internal Facebook documents leaked by Haugen. (The consortium's work is based on many of the same
        documents.)<br>
        The publication of the Journal's "Facebook Files," which raised concerns about the impact of Instagram on teen
        girls, among other issues, prompted a Senate subcomittee hearing with Facebook head of global safety Antigone
        Davis. Haugen herself then testified before the Senate subcommittee, during which she said she believes that
        "Facebook's products harm children, stoke division, and weaken our democracy."<br>
        There's currently no end in sight for Facebook's troubles. Members of the subcommittee have called for Facebook
        CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. And on Friday, another former Facebook employee anonymously filed a complaint
        against the company to the SEC, with allegations similar to Haugen's.<br>

        <b>Meet the luxury travel agent who plans trips for former US presidents and world leaders</b><br>
        On a personal trip to Ethiopia in 2015, former US President George W. Bush encountered a pleasant surprise.
        When he arrived in the ancient Christian town of Lalibela, dozens of children wearing royal blue Texas Ranger
        hats -- one of the Texan's favorite sports teams -- gave him a warm welcome.<br><br>

        "We prepared a lot of cool surprises on that trip," Jaclyn Sienna India, founder of the Sienna Charles luxury
        lifestyle company, tells CNN Travel.<br>
        "I try to think of cool ways to make (travelers) excited, so I bought about 100 Texas Rangers hats. And when
        Bush came to the village, all the kids had them on."<br><br>

        Personal touches, exclusivity, security, discretion -- these are the things that world leaders have come to
        expect while traveling.<br>
        "It's very much like theater -- world leaders have this vision of what this place could be like, how exotic and
        how amazing," adds India. "And we want to fulfill that vision with special moments."<br>
        Bush was not the first world leader India worked with. Her agency has planned more than 100 journeys for at
        least 15 presidents, prime ministers and premiers since 2012.<br>
        "Whether it's a former president or billionaire or celebrity, everybody's an individual," she says.<br>
        "If you understand what makes them tick and why are they taking that trip, it will be a successful
        relationship."

        <b>The iPod turns 20. Here's how it changed the way I think about music</b><br>
        Twenty years ago this weekend, Apple launched the original, iconic iPod. Six years later, I was gifted my first
        and only version of the device: a third-generation iPod Nano, fit with a square screen, a click wheel and an
        engraving on the back: "Sofia Barrett, Happy 11th Birthday."<br><br>

        By that time, the iPod line had begun its long decline from relevance. Apple had already introduced the iPhone,
        which would become the centerpiece of its ecosystem of products, and catapult it toward being the most valuable
        tech company in the world. But for the next five years — a key part of my teenage life — the iPod helped shape
        my relationship with music and technology.<br><br>

        If the iPod was a gateway for many customers into Apple's hardware and software products, it was also an early
        gateway for me into a type of consumption that we take for granted online: a seemingly limitless amount of
        content, available the moment you want it at the tap of a button, often for less than it cost in the analog era.
        (Though, as a teenager with no job, I still asked my parents for their credit cards to buy songs like
        "Fergalicious" and "Hot N Cold" for $1.29 a piece.)<br><br>

        Sure, my generation had always been able to take their music with them — in my case, starting with using my
        parents' portable CD player in elementary school — but the iPod took that to another level. It was more
        transportable, came in pretty colors and made it easy to listen to far more artists at a time.<br><br>

        But the next generation of music listening also changed how I thought about the music. I found myself caring far
        too much about iTunes data showing when an album was released, what genre it was classified as, and how many
        times I replayed each track. My music taste and enjoyment was all at once simplified into data points.<br><br>

        As I started to use my iPod and iTunes daily, the data helped me understand my listening habits. On my iPod, I
        kept an eye on the Recently Played and Top Rated playlists that came pre-programmed. On iTunes, I used every
        data column at my disposal: last played, date added, number of skips, and release date. It was concerning how
        much I parsed my enjoyment of Rihanna's "Disturbia" into numbers as opposed to how 'danceable' it was. My entire
        music listening experience felt gamified -- sometimes quite literally, in the form of the 'Music Quiz' game on
        my iPod -- which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. I was curating my own experience, listening to the artists I
        wanted, on my own terms.
